🚀 Project Title
DigitVision: Handwritten Digit Recognition with KNN

You’re building an intelligent system that recognizes handwritten digits using the classic MNIST dataset and the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The name blends clarity, purpose, and a tech vibe.

# DigitVision: Handwritten Digit Recognition with KNN

DigitVision is a machine learning project built with Python and Scikit-learn that classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

### 📦 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)
- Format: CSV files containing pixel values of 28x28 grayscale digit images
- Size: ~60,000 training samples and ~28,000 test samples

### 🧠 Methodology
- Data preprocessing using **Pandas**
  - Dropping labels, handling missing data (if any), and formatting input features
- Model training with **KNeighborsClassifier** from Scikit-learn
  - Hyperparameter tuning via **GridSearchCV**
  - Best parameters selected for optimal accuracy
- Evaluation on validation set and final prediction on test data
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib**
  - Displays digit images using pixel reshaping

### 🔮 Prediction Output
- Generates `submission.csv` compatible with Kaggle’s evaluation system
- Includes predicted labels and image IDs for the test set

### 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Matplotlib 🎨
- NumPy 🔢

### ✅ Results
- Achieved accurate classification with tuned hyperparameters:  
  `n_neighbors = 10`, `p = 2` using Minkowski distance metric

### 📤 Deployment
- Final predictions exported to `submission.csv`
- Ready for Kaggle submission and competition leaderboard testing
